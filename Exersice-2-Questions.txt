Task 1
      
Convert the do…..While loop into while loop

int=1;
While (I<6)
{
System.out.println(“ I will get printed once for sure!”)
I++;
}


Task 2

Limitation for each loop
>Elements can’t retrieve based on the index
>Transverse of reverse order is not possible
>Modification of array element values is not possible

Question 1

Double: It is a type floating point It is used for High accuracy of decimal value of 15 digit after the decimal point 
              Eg:10.897989647830923
Float:It is the type of Floating point Float data type shows the result accuracy is 7 digit after the decimal point
              Eg:12.9087654

Question 2 
                Negative numbers can’t be assigned to char .As char is an unsigned data types
                 
Question 3
                 The output is 22 .a++ is increment the value is 11 and after using the concatenation  ++a also increment the value is 11 so the output is 22

Question 4
                The output is 9 .it is a unary operator It gives positive of total minus
Question 5
                If evaluation of a logical expression exits in between before complete evaluation, then it is known as Short-circuit.A short circuit happens because the result is clear even before the complete evaluation of the expression, and the result is returned.
